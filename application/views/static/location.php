	<h1>Location</h1>
</div>
<p>FroSoCo is located on the west side of campus, occupying two adjoining houses, Adams and Schiff, in Governor's Corner. You will be assigned to either Adams or Schiff, both of which house freshmen and sophomores. An adjacent dining hall, Ricker, serves both the College and two other houses and is nut-free. While we are as close to classes as the large dorms on the east side of campus - closer if you are taking science or engineering courses - you will also be able to enjoy the beautiful open spaces of the west side of campus. We are right near the golf course, tennis courts, the historic Stanford barn, and the scenic surroundings of Lake Lagunita with easy access to the trails leading up to the gorgeous views of the Bay from Stanford's "Dish".</p>
