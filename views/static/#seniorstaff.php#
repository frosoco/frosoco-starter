           Our College includes 22 professional and student staff members. 
           Each of these professionals is deeply committed to undergraduate education and the purposes of the College. 
           The same is certainly true of this year's outstanding student staff.
       </p>
       <p>
           Each of the two houses offers four upper-class undergraduates serving as College Assistants (CAs),
           and a live-in, professional couple serving as College Directors (CDs). 
           Across the College we have students serving as Residence Computer Coordinators (RCCs), 
           a Resident Multimedia Consultant (RMC), an Oral Communications Tutor (OCT), 
           and a Peer Health Educator (PHE). There is an extended staff of academic advisors 
           (faculty or professional staff), such as a College-specific Academic Director (AD). 
           Our Residence Dean (RD) handles student mental health and behavioral issues.  
           The College's staff is rounded out by the Residential Programs Manager (RPM). 
           The College is led by the Dean of the Freshman-Sophomore College.

   <h2>Nadeem Hussain</h2>
   <h4>Dean</h4>
   <p>Nadeem Hussain is an Associate Professor of Philosophy and was recently appointed the Senior Associate Vice Provost of Residential Affairs where he coordinates programming in undergraduate residences.  As an Associate Professor of Philosophy, his research focuses on whether there really are any moral truths or facts and whether moral values, or just values in general, are compatible with science (and what to do if they are not). He was born just outside Chicago, but grew up mostly in Pakistan with summers in the U.S. or Italy. Nadeem completed his undergraduate degree at Stanford, originally planning to be a physicist, but eventually majored in the Symbolic Systems Program, an interdisciplinary major that focuses on computers and minds. Nonetheless, he remained part of a particle physics experiment thanks to Stanford's amazing opportunities for undergraduate research. After graduating in 1990, Nadeem went on to study Philosophy at The University of Michigan and received his doctorate in 1999. He joined the faculty at Stanford in 2000. When there isn't an important cricket match going on, Nadeem loves intense conversations about almost anything. He is a regular scuba diver and enjoys playing squash or cricket and horse riding.</p>
   <p>As the Dean, Nadeem has the immense pleasure of hosting some of our wonderful events including the "Dinner at the Deans" series. These dinners are great intellectual opportunities but also allows him to introduce you to people engaged in a wide range of interesting and important endeavors at Stanford, Silicon Valley, and beyond. (He met his future mentor, the philosopher John Perry - who is still a professor at Stanford - through just such a dinner when Nadeem was a freshman.) He also hosts many of the large College welcoming events, FroSoCafes, and fun Friday BBQs at the Dean's residence.  He'll be seeing you at the Dean's residence on many, many occasions and looks forward to getting to know you.</p>
