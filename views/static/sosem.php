        <p>
         FroSoFold is a hands-on exploration of the mathematical and aesthetic principles behind origami, the art of paper-folding. We'll be walking students step-by-step through the construction of a variety of models every session ranging from the simple to the highly complex, as well as discussing the history and science behind this ancient art form. In the context of origami, your instructors will cover topics such as mathematical constructibility, graph theory, and more- no background required, but an interest in mathematical thinking is recommended! Paper will be provided for all in-class activities, and there will be additional paper for students to keep folding their own models even after the conclusion of the class. Warning: you may never see a sheet of paper the same way again.

          We will take a close look at the struggles faced by marginalized groups and the actions community members can take to create a more respectful and inclusive environment for them. We will discuss issues of race, sexuality, gender, class - amongst other social statuses, how identity is created and destroyed, what privilege is and how to use it, and examine popular culture to come to conclusions about the media's role in perpetuating stereotypes and erasing large aspects of identity.

	<p>
	 FroSoFold is a hands-on exploration of the mathematical and aesthetic principles behind origami, the art of paper-folding. We'll be walking students step-by-step through the construction of a variety of models every session ranging from the simple to the highly complex, as well as discussing the history and science behind this ancient art form. In the context of origami, your instructors will cover topics such as mathematical constructibility, graph theory, and more- no background required, but an interest in mathematical thinking is recommended! Paper will be provided for all in-class activities, and there will be additional paper for students to keep folding their own models even after the conclusion of the class. Warning: you may never see a sheet of paper the same way again.

			Humans of FroSoCo will be a journey through our collective history! These are our stories, and we want to share them. We will take a photojournalist's approach, in the style of renowned photography blog, Humans of New York, to photograph and interview each resident. Students will be taught basic photography skills before being turned loose on the world. Owning your own camera is not necessary.

        <h4>Kensen Shi</h4>
	<h4>Thursday evenings, 8:00 - 9:00 PM</h4>
        <p>In this seminar, we will learn how to solve the Rubik's cube. No prior experience is necessary, and high-quality cubes will be provided to all registered participants. There are many different methods of solving the cube - as a baseline, we will learn a very basic layer-by-layer method, but several advanced variations and optimizations will also be presented. If time permits, we will briefly explore other solving methods, blindfold cubing, cube mathematics, and/or other twisty puzzles.</p>
